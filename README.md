# Unit 5 Homework - Work Day Scheduler

## Description

I was given the assignment through Triliogy/WASHU Coding Bootcamp to create an application that "allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code".  Additionally the app was to run in the brower and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The user story was that, "AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner SO THAT I can manage my time effectively".

The additional acceptance criteria was as follows:

- WHEN I open the planner THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- WHEN I scroll down THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
- WHEN I view the time blocks for that day THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- WHEN I click into a time block THEN I can enter an event
- WHEN I click the save button for that time block THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
- WHEN I refresh the page THEN the saved events persist
